This folder contains scripts that will compute the flLp table. Because this is slow (oscillating integrands), it is split into a script per value of ell.


compute_lensing_beyondLimber_flLp_table_masterfiletocopy.py   :: This is the master script that will be copied and tailored to deal with a specific ell value

setup_script.py                                               :: This file prepares a script to deal with every entry of the chosen l1_array in ../prepare_for_lenscov.py

compute_lensing_beyondLimber_flLp_table_index_*               :: Each of these files does the calculation for each given ell value and writes the corresponding flLp that will be read by 
                                                                 the covariance file ../compute_lensing_beyondLimber_SSC.py

	These tables were generated elsewhere for the fiducial cosmology:

		Omega_m h^2  = 0.14695
		Omega_b h^2  = 0.02205
		h            = 0.7
                ns           = 0.96
                sigma_8(z=0) = 0.83


	The tables contain power spectra, their first and second derivatives w.r.t. k, and the growth-only response functions G1, G2 and GK.

	For the spectra, there is the option in ../prepare_for_lensing.py to choose between CAMB or the Coyote emulator.

	For the responses, they come from separate universe simulation measurements.
